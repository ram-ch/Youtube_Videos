Symptoms include the strong and frequent sensation or urge to urinate, pain during urination, and urine that is cloudy.[10] The main causal agent is Escherichia coli. Urine is typically sterile but contains a variety of salts, and waste products.[11] Bacteria can ascend into the bladder or kidney and causing cystitis and nephritis.\\nBacterial gastroenteritis is caused by enteric, pathogenic bacteria. These pathogenic species are usually distinct from the usually harmless bacteria of the normal gut flora. But a different strain of the same species may be pathogenic. The distinction is sometimes difficult as in the case of Escherichia.\\nBacterial skin infections include:\\nImpetigo is a highly contagious bacterial skin infection commonly seen in children.[12] It is caused by Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes.[13]\\nErysipelas is an acute streptococcus bacterial infection[14] of the deeper skin layers that spreads via with lymphatic system.\\nCellulitis is a diffuse inflammation[15] of connective tissue with severe inflammation of dermal and subcutaneous layers of the skin. Cellulitis can be caused by normal skin flora or by contagious contact, and usually occurs through open skin, cuts, blisters, cracks in the skin, insect bites, animal bites, burns, surgical wounds, intravenous drug injection, or sites of intravenous catheter insertion. In most cases it is the skin on the face or lower legs that is affected, though cellulitis can occur in other tissues.\"\n",
